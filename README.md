# Web-Scraper to Obtain Food Facility Records and Violations
Python script to scrape data from a website and display it as well as store it in a JSON structure

# Details
The script uses python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup. The script parses the HTML in the page by 
finding the correct tags for each information needed.

The program will print out the following information to the console:
1. Facility Name
2. Full Address
3. Inspection Date
4. Inspection Grade

The information is also then stored into a JSON structure and written out to memory in a text file 
called "data.txt".
